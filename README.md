My Experiments with Selenium :)

Prerequisite : pip install -U selenium

### website_visit.py
Basic script which visits youtube.com and runs test

### code.py
This script runs test for the following procedure - Coding in codepad followed by (delusional) interaction through comments and login. Base Inspiration [here](https://gist.github.com/hugs/830011)

image_outputs/delusional_talk.gif illustrates a random procedure:

* User enters python command in shell and submits
* Command gets printed
* Another person comments on it
* Directed to login page as login required to comment
* Credentials entered
* Comment gets posted
* Initial user replies back to it in the shell
